# GivAPI
GivEnergy API Interface. Doesn't include much at the moment.

getData(serial, api_key) returns current data.\n
getDate(serial, api_key, date) returns data for said date. Requires an ISO8601 date.
getAcc(api_key) returns your account data.

Install with pip install GivAPI (import with 'import givapi').
